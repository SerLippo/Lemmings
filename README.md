​		Lemmings is a verilog sequential practice from HDLBits. Lemmings can walk, fall and dig, But lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging.

​		Please visit https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Lemmings4 to check out the FSM.

​		I took the lemmings as a DUT and designed a UVM environment for it.
